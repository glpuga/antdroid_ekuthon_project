/*
 * Allows us to have a default calibration before we start to run the
 * Antfirm code for the 18 servos que have attached to the Arduino
 * MEGA board. This calibration is saved in the internal EEPROM memory
 * of the board. For debug and testing proves, we have added a function
 * to know the actual values of the memory

 * The functions are:

 * currentCalibration(): send by serial port all the calibration angles.
 * writeCalibrationCompleted(): write byte in eeprom to define calibration
 * completed.
 * tryCalibrationCompleted(): return true if calibration completed
